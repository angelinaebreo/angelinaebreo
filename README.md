I am a highly motivated, responsible, and detail-oriented Full Stack Software Developer who is passionate about creating social change and making a difference through innovative, powerful technologies. I am currently enrolled at Pursuit, an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. A life-long learner, I am excited to master coding which to me is an art of combining creativity and logic.

Passionate about utilizing programming and technology to problem-solve and leave a positive long-lasting impact, I want to create thoughtful quality features that will improve productivity, bring people together, and encourage growth.

I am looking to join a forward-thinking company where I can utilize my strong problem solving, communication, and critical thinking skills in order to help create thoughtful, intelligent solutions.

When I am not learning to code, I enjoy solving logical puzzles, reading, and experiencing the diverse languages, cultures, and cuisines of the world.
